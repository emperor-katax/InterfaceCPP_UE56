> [!IMPORTANT]
> To use this application, intermediate C++ programming skills with Unreal Engine, knowledge of using <b>Events</b> and <b>Parent Class</b> and also, basic knowledge of develop <b>Blueprint Interface</b> are required.

This application:

> Send and recive data by using C++ Blueprint implementable interface<br>
> Send and recive data by using pure C++ interface<br>
> Using C++ actor component <br>
> Using C++ line trace <br>
> Using parent class to inherit and run interface<br>


Using:

C++ Blueprint implementable interface<br>
C++ pure interface<br>
C++ actor component<br>
C++ line Trace <br>
C++ inheritance <br>


<h4>This project is designed for teaching application development with Unreal Engine, by demonstration a free to use functional prototype.<br>The project template is optimized to reduce size of zip-file.<br> </h4>
